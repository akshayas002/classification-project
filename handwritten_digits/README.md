# 🖼️ Handwritten Digits Image Classification

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates **image classification** using the **Scikit-learn Digits dataset**. The goal is to classify images of handwritten digits (0–9) using multiple machine learning models and compare their performance. We also visualize results with confusion matrices for deeper insights.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** `sklearn.datasets.load_digits()`
- **Type:** Tabular representation of images
- **Samples:** 1,797 images of 8×8 pixels
- **Features:** 64 pixel intensity values (0–16)
- **Target:** Digit label (0–9)

## 📊 Project Workflow
1. **Load Dataset** – Import from scikit-learn
2. **Data Exploration** – View sample images and shapes
3. **Train-Test Split** – 80% training, 20% testing
4. **Model Training** – Train three models:
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
5. **Evaluation** – Accuracy score & confusion matrix
6. **Visualization** – Matplotlib & Seaborn plots

## 📈 Results

### 🖼 Image Classification (Handwritten Digits)
| Metric     | Value  |
|------------|--------|
| Accuracy   | ~0.97  |

- **Observation:** High accuracy achieved with a simple feedforward neural network. Image data is easier to classify with CNNs or more complex models, which could push accuracy further.

## 📚 Key Concepts Learned

- **Pixel Normalization**: Scaling pixel values improves training stability.
- **Dense Layers for Image Data**: Can work for simple datasets like MNIST.
- **Confusion Matrix Analysis**: Detects which digits are commonly misclassified.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Use **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for spatial feature extraction.
- Apply **data augmentation** (rotation, scaling, flipping) to improve generalization.
- Experiment with **dropout** and **batch normalization** for better regularization.
